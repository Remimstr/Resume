		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			I am an energetic software developer with a passion for best practices and writing high quality, scalable, and well tested code. In my 6+ years of software development, I have designed, built, tested, and maintained complex front-end codebases; improved everything from code to product management practices to onboarding docs, and scrum processes; and managed small teams of developers and interns. I am not afraid to voice my opinions, back them up with evidence, and put in the elbow grease needed to change things for the better!
