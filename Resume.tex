		\vspace{2pt}
		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			I am an energetic software developer with a passion for best practices and elegant, functional design. 
			My greatest strength is the ability to thrive at the intersection of cross-functional disciplines and adapt as necessary.
			In my 3+ years of software development, I have designed, built, tested, and maintained a complex front-end codebase;
			whiteboarded designs in front of peers and clients; and managed small teams of developers and interns.
